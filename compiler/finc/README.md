# finc

`finc` is the Fin compiler track.

## Planned Pipeline

1. Lexer and parser.
2. Type inference and checking.
3. Ownership/borrow analysis.
4. Lowered IR.
5. Direct machine-code encoding.
6. Final executable image writer (ELF first, PE second).

## Current State

Design and contracts are defined; implementation code will be added incrementally under proposal control.
