# fin CLI Contract (Draft)

The `fin` command is the single entry point for compiler and package workflows.

## Commands

- `fin init`: create a new package layout.
- `fin build`: compile current package.
- `fin run`: build and execute current package.
- `fin test`: run package tests.
- `fin fmt`: format `.fn` files.
- `fin doc`: generate API and language docs.
- `fin pkg add <name>`: add dependency.
- `fin pkg publish`: publish package.
- `fin doctor`: validate environment and policy constraints.

This contract is normative once `FIP-0015` reaches `Accepted`.
